    <para>By default, m0n0wall enables its DHCP server on its LAN interface, and
    configures the LAN interface with IP address 192.168.1.1.  If you have an
    existing DHCP server, and/or wish to use a different IP subnet on your LAN,
    you will need to connect via the WRAP's serial console. </para>
    
    <note>Unless you know what you're doing, we <emphasis>strongly recommend
    </emphasis> not changing the LAN IP address or pre-configured DHCP settings
    to avoid difficulties caused by misconfiguration.
    </note>
    
    <para>If you do not need to change the interface assignments, LAN IP address,
    or DHCP server settings, you can skip ahead to the <link linkend="Client.Machine.Config">

            purchase a null modem cable at most any store that carries computer cables,
            or from a variety of online sources. (<ulink url="http://froogle.google.com/froogle?q=null+modem+cable">Froogle

            <para>For Windows users, HyperTerminal isn't great, but it gets the job
            done.  You can find it under Start, Programs, Communications, HyperTerminal.
            If you cannot find it on your system, you can download it for free <ulink

            <para>After opening HyperTerminal, you will see the New Connection screen.</para>

            <para>Type in something for the connection name and click OK.</para>
            
            <para>Next, you'll see the "Connect to" screen.  Select the COM port
            number of the serial port in your PC.  If you do not know which it is,
            trial and error might be the easiest way to determine this.  Start
            with COM1, and try other ports if necessary.  In this case, I know my
            serial port is COM1.</para>

            <para>Now you'll see the Connection Properties screen.  If you have
            changed the console speed on your WRAP, you will need to change the
            "Bits per second" field accordingly. </para>

        <para>To recap from earlier, your system is now ready to be configured.  You
        are able to view the console at 38400 bps (or via a video card and monitor)
        and have the media you loaded with m0n0wall earlier installed in the target
        machine.
        </para>
        
        <para>When your system finishes booting, you will see the m0n0wall console.

    <title>Assigning Interfaces</title>
    
    <para>Press 1 at the console setup screen if you wish to reassign your
    network interfaces.</para>
    
    <note>To avoid potential problems with mis-assignment, we recommend
    leaving your interface assignments as is.</note>
    
    <para>On a three Ethernet port WRAP, sis0 is the NIC closest to the
    power adapter connector, sis1 is the middle Ethernet port, and sis2
    is the Ethernet port closest to the serial port.</para>
    
    <para>On a two Ethernet port WRAP, sis0 is the NIC closest to the
    power adapter connector, and sis1 is the NIC closest to the serial
    port.</para>

Enter a number: 1

Valid interfaces are:

sis0    00:0c:29:96:5e:de
sis1    00:0c:29:96:53:e8

Do you want to set up VLANs first?
If you're not going to use VLANs, or only for optional interfaes, you
should say no here and use the webGUI to configure VLANs later, if required.

Do you want to set up VLANs now? (y/n) 
    </literallayout>

    <para>As this guide only leads you through a simple two interface configuration,
        we will press n and hit enter here to skip VLAN configuration.  If you need
        VLAN support, configure it in the webGUI after this initial configuration
        is complete.</para>
    
    <literallayout class="monospaced">
If you don't know the names of your interfaces, you may choose to use
auto-detection.  In that case, disconnect all interfaces before you begin,
and reconnect each one when prompted to do so.

Enter the LAN interface name or 'a' for auto-detection:
    </literallayout>
    
    <para>Enter the name of the desired LAN interface (sis0 or sis1 on a two port WRAP,
    sis0, sis1, or sis2 on a three port WRAP) and press Enter.</para>

    <literallayout class="monospaced">
Enter the WAN interface name or 'a' for auto-detection
(or nothing if finished):
</literallayout>
        
    <para>Enter one of the remaining available interfaces and press Enter.</para>
        
    <para>Next you will be prompted for assigning optional interfaces.
    You can do this later through the webGUI if need be.  Without entering
    anything, hit ENTER at this prompt.</para>

Enter the Optional 1 interface name or 'a' for auto-detection

The interfaces will be assigned as follows:

LAN  -> sis1
WAN  -> sis0

The firewall will reboot after saving the changes.

Do you want to proceed? (y/n)

    <para>This confirms how the interfaces will be assigned.  Press y and hit enter
    here to restart the firewall for the changes to take effect.  To discard your
    changes, enter n and press Enter.</para>
