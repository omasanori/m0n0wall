  <para>The instructions below will have you download a m0n0wall file called
  an image that contains the bootable operating system. This image will be
  written to a Compact Flash card. Finally you will install the Compact Flash
  card into the Soekris system and connect the ethernet cables.</para>

  <para>It is assumed that you have a working PC computer with the proper
  Ethernet cables and the default BIOS options chosen to boot from a Compact
  Flash card. These instructions are for a Windows, FreeBSD or Linux operating
  system.</para>

  <para>Because the Compact Flash card is writable, your customized changes to
  the default configuration will be stored in the card itself and be used for
  subsequent reboots of the Soekris embedded system. In all cases the
  configuration file can be downloaded from the web interface for external
  storage.</para>

  <tip>
    <para>It is recommended to always store an external backup of your
    configuration file in case of emergencies.</para>
  </tip>

  <para>It might save you some troubleshooting time if you first verify that
  your system is in working condition. One easy way to do this is to boot the
  Soekris system while connected to the serial console interface (see your
  Soekris documentation for how to do this.) you can then verify that the
  entire system is ready to run m0n0wall.</para>

  <warning>
    <para>Some configurations of the Soekris systems have difficulties booting
    from either certain types of Compact Flash cards or when a Compact Flash
    card and a disk drive are connected at the same time. Try to pick a
    Compact Flash card that is known to boot or that has been discussed in the
    Soekris mailing list.</para>

    <para>To download a Soekris image file, point your web browser to <ulink
    url="http://www.m0n0.ch/wall/downloads.php">http://www.m0n0.ch/wall/downloads.php</ulink>
    and select the net45xx or net48xx download link from that page, depending
    on the model of your board. Download the file to the machine from which
    you will be writing to the CompactFlash card.</para>

      <title>Writing the Image File</title>

      <para>If you are installing to a standard PC using an IDE or CF disk,
      you need to write the image to a sufficiently large CF card or hard disk
      (at least 10 MB for the generic-PC image in version 1.3). Extra space on
      the CF card or drive is ignored; there is no benefit to using one larger
      than 16 MB other than possibly compatibility on future releases.</para>

      <para>The following sections will cover how to write the CF card in
      Windows, FreeBSD, and Linux. A summary is below with details following
      for each operating system.</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>Windows:</para>

          <para>(use the -u flag if the target disk is &gt; 800 MB - make very
          sure you've selected the right disk!!) <programlisting>physdiskwrite [-u] generic-pc-xxx.img</programlisting>(you
          must use v0.3 or later!)</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>FreeBSD:</para>

          <para><programlisting>gzcat generic-pc-xxx.img | dd of=/dev/rad[n] bs=16k</programlisting>where
          n = the ad device number of your CF card (check dmesg) (ignore the
          warning about trailing garbage - it's because of the digital
          signature)</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Linux:</para>

          <para><programlisting>gunzip -c generic-pc-xxx.img | dd of=/dev/hdX bs=16k</programlisting>where
          X = the IDE device name of your HD/CF card (check with hdparm -i
          /dev/hdX) - some CF adapters, particularly USB, may show up under
          SCSI emulation as /dev/sdX (ignore the warning about trailing
          garbage - it's because of the digital signature)</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <sect3>
        <title>Windows</title>

        <para>For Windows you will be downloading physdiskwrite from the
        m0n0wall web site. This is a small Windows NT/2000/XP command line
        tool that makes it possible to write disk images onto raw disks, like
        CF cards. It currently has a few rough edges, most notably in the
        selection of the device to be written – you have to decide which
        device is the right one by looking at the C/H/S values (though if the
        CF card was the last device to be connected to the system, it usually
        shows up as the last one in the list).</para>

        <para>Note that the C/H/S values may be incorrect for CF cards – looks
        like this is a bug in Windows. There is some protection against
        accidentally overwriting your hard disk, but then again,<emphasis
        role="bold"> I CAN'T TAKE ANY RESPONSIBILITY FOR LOST DATA – YOU USE
        THIS PROGRAM ON YOUR OWN RISK.</emphasis></para>

        <para>Manuel Kasper's (author of m0n0wall) physdiskwrite should be
        used on Windows to write the CF card. Download it from the m0n0wall
        web site's <ulink url="http://www.m0n0.ch/wall/physdiskwrite.php">
        physdiskwrite page</ulink>.</para>

        <note>
          <para>Note to Windows Vista users: physdiskwrite works with Vista,
          but you must make sure to run it as administrator (simply having
          admin rights isn't enough), or it won't find any disks. One way to
          do this is to create a shortcut to cmd.exe, then right-click it and
          select "run as administrator". Then you can launch physdiskwrite
          from the command prompt window that appears, and it should work
          fine.</para>
        </note>

        <para>Save physdiskwrite.exe and the downloaded m0n0wall image in the
        same directory on your hard drive, then open a Windows Command Prompt
        (click Start, Run, type in cmd and click OK).</para>

        <para>Plug in your CF card reader/writer and insert your CF card. If
        you are connecting your hard drive you can either connect it directly
        to your computer or through a fire wire or USB adaptor for external
        drives.</para>

        <para>'cd' into the directory containing physdiskwrite and the
        m0n0wall image and run the following:</para>

        <programlisting>physdiskwrite net45xx-xxx.img</programlisting>

        <para>Replacing net45xx-xxx.img with the name of the Soekris image you
        downloaded.</para>

        <tip>
          <para>Windows users can just simply drag-and-drop the image file
          onto the physdiskwrite.exe icon.</para>
        </tip>

        <para>You will see output similar to the following:</para>

        <warning>
          <para>If you are using physdiskwrite.exe to write to a second hard
