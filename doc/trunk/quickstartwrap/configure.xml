  <title>Initial Configuration</title>

  <sect1>
    <title>Initial Configuration</title>

    <para>By default, m0n0wall enables its DHCP server on its LAN interface,
    and configures the LAN interface with IP address 192.168.1.1. If you have
    an existing DHCP server, and/or wish to use a different IP subnet on your
    LAN, you will need to first connect via the WRAP/ALIX's serial console
    interface.</para>

    <note>
      <para>Unless you know what you're doing, we <emphasis>strongly
      recommend</emphasis> not changing the LAN IP address or pre-configured
      DHCP settings to avoid difficulties caused by misconfiguration.</para>
    </note>

    <para>If you do not need to change the interface assignments, LAN IP
    address, or DHCP server settings, you can skip ahead to the <link
    linkend="Client.Machine.Config">next chapter</link>. Otherwise, below are
    steps to make changes to the default configuration using your m0n0wall
    system's serial console interface.</para>

    <note>
      <para>The default configuration for m0n0wall does not activate a
      wireless interface, even if one is installed. That means that you can
      not change the default configuration using only a wireless connection.
      You must be connected by Ethernet or Serial console cable to make the
      first configuration change.</para>

    <title>Connecting to the WRAP/ALIX serial console</title>

    <para>Most ALIX boards from PC Engines have serial console interfaces.
    However boards with video interfaces like the ALIX.3c3 and the mini-itx
    size ALIX board do not run tinyBIOS and do not have serial console
    interfaces. These boards are running a version of Award BIOS and the user
    is expected to use the video interface itself with a USB keyboard to
    access the console. </para>

    <sect2>
      <title>Getting the appropriate cable</title>

      <para>First you need a null modem cable, <emphasis>not</emphasis> a
      straight through serial cable. For the appropriate pin-out, see <ulink
      url="http://www.nullmodem.com/NullModem.htm">this page</ulink>. You can
      purchase a null modem cable at most any store that carries computer
      cables, or from a variety of online sources. (<ulink
      url="http://froogle.google.com/froogle?q=null+modem+cable">Froogle
      link</ulink> for null modem cables).</para>

      <para>MacOSX users and PC users that do not have a serial console
      interface can purchase a USB to Serial DB9 adaptor from their local
      computer store. Additionally, some PC motherboard BIOS settings may have
      the serial interface disabled or being used by an internal modem. If you
      experience problems below, verify that your serial interface is
      activated.</para>

      <para>Connect the null modem cable to your embedded device and
      PC.</para>

      <title>Connecting to the serial console</title>

      <para>For Windows users, HyperTerminal isn't great, but it gets the job
      done. You can find it under Start, Programs, Communications,
      HyperTerminal. If you cannot find it on your system, you can download it
      for free <ulink
      url="http://www.hilgraeve.com/hyperterminal.html">here</ulink>.</para>

      <caution>
        <para>Windows Vista does not include HyperTerminal. You can either
        download the free Private Edition of HyperTerminal or use another
        software such as <ulink
        url="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/">PuTTY</ulink>.</para>
      </caution>

      <para>After opening HyperTerminal, you will see the New Connection
      screen.</para>

      <mediaobject>
        <imageobject>
          <imagedata fileref="images/hyperterminal/newconnection.png" />
        </imageobject>
      </mediaobject>

      <para>Type in something for the connection name and click OK.</para>

      <para>Next, you'll see the "Connect to" screen. Select the COM port
      number of the serial port in your PC. If you do not know which it is,
      trial and error might be the easiest way to determine this. Start with
      COM1, and try other ports if necessary. In this case, I know my serial
      port is COM1.</para>

      <mediaobject>
        <imageobject>
          <imagedata fileref="images/hyperterminal/connectto.png" />
        </imageobject>
      </mediaobject>

      <para>Now you'll see the Connection Properties screen. If you have
      changed the console speed on your WRAP/ALIX, you will need to change the
      "Bits per second" field accordingly. If you are unsure on what this
      speed is please check the documentation of your WRAP/ALIX system.</para>

      <mediaobject>
        <imageobject>
          <imagedata fileref="images/hyperterminal/connectionproperties.png" />
        </imageobject>
      </mediaobject>

      <para>Click OK after filling in the Connection Properties appropriately,
      and you will have a blank HyperTerminal screen. Now power on your
      device.</para>

      <para>MacOSX users can use Terminal Emuation software such as <ulink
      url="http://homepage.mac.com/dalverson/zterm/">Zterm</ulink> to access
      the console settings. </para>

    <title>m0n0wall Console Setup</title>

    <para>Your system is now ready to be configured from the console. You are
    able to view the console at 38400 bps and have the media you loaded with
    m0n0wall earlier installed in the target machine.</para>

    <para>When your system finishes booting, you will see the m0n0wall
    console.</para>

    <para>Although this example shows sis0 and sis1 as the two Ethernet
    interfaces these names depend on the Ethernet cards that are installed.
    These 4 characters simply identify the driver used to access the Ethernet
    card and the number of cards that are using the same driver. Other

      <para>First I will explain the purpose of each menu option.</para>

      <para><emphasis role="bold">Option 1</emphasis> allows you to assign
      network interfaces to be used for LAN, WAN, and OPT networks, as well as
      allowing you to configure VLAN's.</para>

      <para><emphasis role="bold">Option 2</emphasis> allows you to set the
      LAN IP address to something other than the default 192.168.1.1.</para>

      <para><emphasis role="bold">Option 3</emphasis> allows you to reset the
      webGUI password if you have forgotten it.</para>

      <para><emphasis role="bold">Option 4</emphasis> lets you reset the
      system to factory default configuration. If you get stuck at some point
      during configuration, sometimes it is easier to start over from
      scratch.</para>

    <title>Assigning Interfaces</title>

    <para>Press 1 at the console setup screen if you wish to reassign your
    network interfaces.</para>

    <note>
      <para>To avoid potential problems with mis-assignment, we recommend
      leaving your interface assignments as is.</para>
    </note>

    <para>On a three Ethernet port WRAP, sis0 is the NIC closest to the power
    adapter connector, sis1 is the middle Ethernet port, and sis2 is the
    Ethernet port closest to the serial port.</para>

    <para>On a two Ethernet port WRAP, sis0 is the NIC closest to the power
    adapter connector, and sis1 is the NIC closest to the serial port.</para>

    <literallayout class="monospaced">
Enter a number: 1

Valid interfaces are:

sis0    00:0c:29:96:5e:de
sis1    00:0c:29:96:53:e8

Do you want to set up VLANs first?
If you're not going to use VLANs, or only for optional interfaes, you
should say no here and use the webGUI to configure VLANs later, if required.

Do you want to set up VLANs now? (y/n) 
    </literallayout>

    <para>As this guide only leads you through a simple two interface
    configuration, we will press n and hit enter here to skip VLAN
    configuration. If you need VLAN support, configure it in the webGUI after
    this initial configuration is complete. You can use the Valid interfaces
    list to see how your installed Ethernet cards are identified by the
    m0n0wall operating system.</para>

    <literallayout class="monospaced">
If you don't know the names of your interfaces, you may choose to use
auto-detection.  In that case, disconnect all interfaces before you begin,
and reconnect each one when prompted to do so.

Enter the LAN interface name or 'a' for auto-detection:
    </literallayout>

    <para>Enter the name of the desired LAN interface (sis0 or sis1 on a two
    port WRAP/ALIX, sis0, sis1, or sis2 on a three port WRAP/ALIX) and press
    Enter.</para>

    <literallayout class="monospaced">
Enter the WAN interface name or 'a' for auto-detection
(or nothing if finished):
</literallayout>

    <para>Enter one of the remaining available interfaces and press
    Enter.</para>

    <para>Next you will be prompted for assigning optional interfaces. You can
    do this later through the webGUI if need be. Without entering anything,
    hit ENTER at this prompt.</para>

    <literallayout class="monospaced">
Enter the Optional 1 interface name or 'a' for auto-detection
(or nothing if finished):
</literallayout>

    <para>You will now see how your interfaces have been configured.</para>

    <literallayout class="monospaced">
The interfaces will be assigned as follows:

LAN  -&gt; sis1
WAN  -&gt; sis0

The firewall will reboot after saving the changes.

Do you want to proceed? (y/n)
    </literallayout>

    <para>This confirms how the interfaces will be assigned. Press y and hit
    enter here to restart the firewall for the changes to take effect. To
    discard your changes, enter n and press Enter. If all of your hardware and
    cables are correctly installed you should be able to reach the m0n0wall at
    the 192.168.1.1 IP address from a client computer.</para>
