    <title>Aliases</title>

    <para>You may have noticed throughout the webGUI there are some address
    boxes with a blue background. This blue background indicates you can use
    aliases in this field. The source and destination boxes on the Firewall
    Rules Edit screen are two examples of this.</para>

    <para>Aliases act as placeholders for real IP addresses and can be used to
    minimize the number of changes that have to be made if a host or network
    address changes. You can enter the name of an alias instead of an IP
    address in all address fields that have a blue background. The alias will
    be resolved to its current address according to the defined alias list. If
    an alias cannot be resolved (e.g. because you deleted it), the
    corresponding element (e.g. filter/NAT/shaper rule) will be considered
    invalid and skipped.</para>
