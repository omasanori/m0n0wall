  <para>m0n0wall can connect to any third party VPN device that supports
  standard IPsec site to site VPN's, which includes most any VPN device and
  firewall with IPsec VPN support.</para>

  <para>This chapter will provide instructions on connecting m0n0wall with a
  number of third party IPsec devices.</para>

      <para>If the "VPN-3DES-AES" line above does not show "Enabled", you need
      to install the PIX 3DES key. This is now available free from Cisco
      <ulink
      url="http://www.cisco.com/pcgi-bin/Software/FormManager/formgenerator.pl">
      here</ulink> for all PIX firewalls (click 3DES/AES Encryption License).
      Do NOT use DES for a VPN if you want it to be cryptographically secure.
      DES is only slightly better than transmitting in clear text.</para>

      <para>Next we'll see if any VPN configurations are in place on the
      PIX.</para>

      <blockquote>
        <literallayout class="monospaced">pixfirewall# sh isakmp policy

encryption algorithm: DES - Data Encryption Standard (56 bit keys).

</literallayout>
      </blockquote>

      <para>If you only see the default policy, there are no VPN's configured.
      This document cannot be followed verbatim if you have current VPN's
      (though you should be able to figure it out, just be careful not to
      break your existing VPN's with any duplicate names).</para>

      <para>Allow IPSec connections to the PIX</para>

      <blockquote>
        <literallayout class="monospaced">pixfirewall(config)# sysopt connection permit-ipsec
</literallayout>
      </blockquote>

      <para>Enable ISAKMP on the outside interface (where "outside" is the
      name of the internet-facing interface)</para>

      <blockquote>
        <literallayout class="monospaced">pixfirewall(config)# isakmp enable outside
</literallayout>
      </blockquote>

      <para>isakmp policy command on PIX</para>

      <blockquote>

isakmp policy %lt;priority&gt; group %lt;1|2|5&gt;
isakmp policy %lt;priority&gt; lifetime %lt;seconds&gt;
</literallayout>
      </blockquote>

      <para>Now we need to configure the ISAKMP policy on the PIX. Enter the
      following commands in configure mode:</para>

      <blockquote>
        <literallayout class="monospaced">isakmp policy 10 authen pre-share
isakmp policy 10 encrypt 3des
isakmp policy 10 hash md5
isakmp policy 10 group 2
isakmp policy 10 lifetime 86400    
</literallayout>
      </blockquote>

      <para>This policy uses pre-shared keys as authenticator, 3DES
      encryption, md5 hashing, group 2, and 86400 second lifetime.</para>

      <para>Now we need to define the pre-shared key for this connection.
      (1.1.1.1 = public IP address of m0n0wall, qwertyuiop is the shared key,
      randomly generate something to use for your configuration)</para>

      <blockquote>
        <literallayout class="monospaced">isakmp key qwertyuiop address 1.1.1.1 netmask 255.255.255.255
</literallayout>
      </blockquote>

      <para>Now we need to create an access list defining what traffic can
      cross this tunnel.</para>

      <blockquote>
        <literallayout class="monospaced">access-list monovpn permit ip 10.0.0.0 255.255.255.0 10.0.1.0 255.255.255.0
access-list monovpn permit ip 10.0.0.0 255.255.255.0 10.0.1.0 255.255.255.0
</literallayout>
      </blockquote>

      <para>Define transform set for this connection called
      "monovpnset"</para>

      <blockquote>
        <literallayout class="monospaced">crypto ipsec transform-set monovpnset esp-3des esp-md5-hmac
</literallayout>
      </blockquote>

      <para>Define security association lifetime</para>

      <blockquote>
        <literallayout class="monospaced">crypto ipsec security-association lifetime seconds 86400 kilobytes 50000
</literallayout>
      </blockquote>

      <para>Now to set up the actual connection, the crypto map "monovpnmap".
      (where 1.1.1.1 is the public IP address of the m0n0wall device)</para>

      <blockquote>
        <literallayout class="monospaced">crypto map monovpnmap 10 ipsec-isakmp
crypto map monovpnmap 10 set peer 1.1.1.1
crypto map monovpnmap 10 set transform-set monovpnset
crypto map monovpnmap 10 match address monovpn
</literallayout>
      </blockquote>

      <para>These lines specify type of VPN (ipsec-isakmp), peer IP address
      (1.1.1.1), transform set to be used (monovpnset, defined above), and
      that packets matching the access list "monovpn" created above should
      traverse this VPN connection.</para>

      <para>Last step is to tell the PIX to not use NAT on the packets using
      this VPN connection and route them instead.</para>

      <para>First we'll see if anything is currently routed.</para>

      <blockquote>
        <literallayout class="monospaced">pixfirewall# sh nat
nat (inside) 0 access-list no-nat
</literallayout>
      </blockquote>

      <para>Look for "nat (interface) 0 ..." commands. The above means any
      traffic matching access list "no-nat" will routed, not translated. In
      this instance, we are adding to a current access list (if you use a DMZ,
      you likely have something similar to this set up).</para>

      <blockquote>
        <literallayout class="monospaced">access-list no-nat permit ip 10.0.0.1 255.255.255.0 10.0.1.0 255.255.255.0
access-list no-nat permit ip 10.0.1.0 255.255.255.0 10.0.0.0 255.255.255.0
</literallayout>
      </blockquote>

      <para>If you do not have a "nat (interface) 0 ..." command in your "sh
      nat" output, you can use the above two lines to create a "no-nat" access
      list. You then have to apply it with the "nat (interface-name) 0
      access-list no-nat" command (replacing "interface-name" with the name of
      your LAN interface).</para>

        dropping frequently with this configuration. If this happens, set the

      </note>

      <note>
        <para>If you don't specify a key lifetime in the m0n0wall config, the
        tunnel will work, but appear to go insane after a while. Supposedly
        Cisco's will negotiate a key lifetime, but I have not seen this work
        in my experience. This is also true of a Cisco VPN Concentrator.

    <?dbhtml filename="examplevpn-smoothwall.html"?>

    <title>Smoothwall</title>

    <para>Rev. Tig posted the following information on connecting Smoothwall
    and m0n0wall via IPsec VPN in a post on the mailing list on September 30,
    2004.</para>

    <blockquote>
      <literallayout class="monospaced">I could not find a working solution in the mailing list archives but
here is how I have managed to create a VPN between Smoothwall Corporate
with Smoothtunnel and m0n0wall and I thought I would share it here to
same people going through the same headbashing experience I did :) This
will be far to much of a teaching granny to suck eggs for most people on
the list but it might help someone get up and running quickly.

Variety is the spice of life and just to confuse matters the m0n0wall
box was stuck behind NAT :) The office I was linking to was in a
serviced building and hence the connection was a shared one with a
private IP and public one port forwarded to it.

I had never done this before so corrections are welcome :) I am not
saying these are the best settings all I know is my VPN is up and
running and it seems to be happy :)

What I have created is a VPN between one subnet at one site running
Smoothwall Corporate Server 3.0 with Smoothtunnel and a m0n0wall v1
box sitting behind NAT with a private IP at the other site. Any other
versions of the software may need slightly different settings but
hopefully this should put you in the right ballpark.

First off IPSEC over NAT, if at all possible don't :) If you have to
or for some perverse reason you fancy a crack at this then read on, if
you are just here for the Smoothwall bit scroll down :)

IPSEC over NAT does work but it can be a case of sacrificing the odd
network card to the deity of your choice, what I did in the end was ask
their network guy to just send everything and I will let m0n0 do the
firewalling, this is what I would recommend as then you don't have to
hassle them every time you want a port opening, but from what I have
gathered is that all you need are port 500 forwarding and IP protocols
50 and 51 to be routed but the firewall. Apparently your IPSEC traffic
goes through port 500 but IP protocols 50 and 51 are needed for phase 1
(authentication) and phase 2 (key exchange). If I am wrong (this is
quite possible there will be a load of mails below correcting me :) If
m0n0 is behind NAT and you are certain the other end is right but there
appears to be no attempts to authenticate then check here first.

Now onto Smoothwall Corporate, now I know Rich Morrell posts on here so
I have to be careful about what I say about the interface but that is
just a personal taste thing :)

Right here are the Smoothwall settings :

Local IP : your RED IP address (if you are using Smoothhost then put
the IP of your firewall in)
Local ID type: Local IP
Remote IP : the external IP of your NATted m0n0wall box.
Remote ID type : Remote IP
Authenticate by : Preshared Key
Preshared Key : put your shared key here
Use Compression : Off
Enabled : On
Local network : in this case it was 192.168.0.0/255.255.255.0
Local ID value : same as your Local IP
Remote network: in this case it was 192.168.1.0/255.255.255.0
Remote ID value : the same as your Remote IP
Initiate the connection : Yes

I will use these networks in this example as it shows you a little
gotcha in m0n0wall that threw me because I was not thinking :)

Next block :
Local Certificate : (your local certificate)
Perfect Forward Secrecy : Yes
Authentication type: ESP (it has to be AH will NOT work over NAT)
Phase 1 crypto algo: 3DES
Phase 1 hash algo : MD5
Key life : 480 (mins)
Key tries : 0 (never give up)

Right now the m0n0wall settings :

Phase 1:
Mode : tunnel (well you can't change it and why would you want to :)
Interface : WAN
Local Subnet : 192.168.1.0 / 24 (don't do what I did and select LAN :)
Remote Subnet : 192.168.0.0 / 24
Remote IP : The RED IP of your Smoothwall box
Negotiation Mode : Main
My Identifier : IP Address : Your public IP (non NATed) for your
m0n0wall box
Encryption Algo: 3DES
Hash Algo : MD5
DH Key Group : 5
Lifetime : (blank)
Preshared Key : put your shared key here.

Phase 2:
Protocol : ESP
Encryption Algo: 3DES (only! untick the others)
Hash Algo: MD5 (again only)
PFS Key Group : 5
Lifetime : (blank)

That is it, your can now bring the link up from Smoothwall by going
into the VPN control tab and clicking UP!
