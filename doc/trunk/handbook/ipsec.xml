  <title>IPsec</title>
  <para>This chapter will go over configuring a site to site Virtual Private
    Network (VPN) links between two m0n0walls, discuss how to configure site
    to site links with third party IPsec-compliant devices and discuss VPN to
    remote IPSec client software. Once you have IPSec properly configured you
    will be able to take advantage of the following capabilities:</para>

  <para>The <link linkend="Example.VPN">Example VPN Configurations</link>
    chapter goes over, in detail, how to configure site to site IPsec links
    with some third party IPsec devices. Although it might seem confusing, in
    most cases you just need to assure that all of the parameters match on
    both sides (except of course the definition of who is the remote network).
    Some routing issues might come up depending on your situation but reading
    the rest of this chapter should be enough to successfully use IPsec
    encryption.</para>
  <para>If you have gotten m0n0wall working in a site to site IPsec
    configuration with some third party IPsec device that is not already
    listed, we would appreciate if you could put together a short write up of
    how you got it configured, preferably with screenshots where
    applicable.</para>

    <title>Preface</title>
    <para>IPsec (IP security) is an international standard for providing
      security to IP protocols via encryption and/or authentication, typically
      employing both. Its use in m0n0wall is for<glossterm linkend="gloss.VPN"
        > Virtual Private Networks (VPN's)</glossterm>. After two or more
      points securely authenticate each other's identification, access rights,
      and how to encrypt data (phase 1), they will be able to communicate
      using encrypted data packets (phase 2). The two points can be on a local
      network, a wireless network or even on the Internet.</para>
    <para>There are two general types of IPsec VPN capabilities in m0n0wall,
      site to site and remote access. Site to site will connect entire
      networks while remote access allows mobile users access to secured
      networks.</para>

      <title>Site to Site VPN Explained</title>
      <para>Site to site VPN's connect two locations with static public IP
        addresses and allow traffic to be routed between the two networks.
        This is most commonly used to connect an organization's branch offices
        back to its main office, so branch users can access network resources
        in the main office. Prior to VPN's, much more expensive private Wide
        Area Network (WAN) links like frame relay, point to point T1 lines,
        etc. were commonly used for this functionality. Some organizations are
        moving towards VPN links between sites to take advantage of reduced
        costs.</para>
      <para>Site to site VPN's can also be used to link your home network to a
        friend's home network, to provide access to each other's network
        resources without opening holes in your firewalls.</para>
      <para>While site to site VPN's are a good solution in many cases,
        private WAN links also have their benefits. IPsec adds processing
        overhead, and the Internet has far greater latency than a private
        network, so VPN connections are typically slower (while maybe not
        throughput-wise, they at least have much higher latency). A point to
        point T1 typically has latency of around 4-8 ms, while a typical VPN
        connection will be 30-80+ ms depending on the number of hops on the
        Internet between the two VPN endpoints.</para>
      <tip>
        <para>When deploying VPN's, you should stay with the same ISP for all
          sites if possible, or at a minimum, stay with ISP's that use the
          same backbone provider. Geographic proximity usually has no relation
          to Internet proximity. A server in the same city as you but on a
          different Internet-backbone provider could be as far away from you
          in Internet distance (hops) as a server on the other side of the
          continent. This difference in Internet proximity can make the
          difference between a VPN with 30 ms latency and one with 80+ ms
          latency.</para>
      </tip>
    </sect2>
    <sect2>
      <title>Remote Access IPsec VPN</title>
      <para>m0n0wall provides two means of remote access VPN, PPTP and IPsec
        (with OpenVPN available in beta versions only for now). m0n0wall's
        mobile IPsec functionality has some serious limitations that hinder
        its practicality for many deployments. m0n0wall version 1.2 does
          <emphasis>not</emphasis> support NAT-Traversal (NAT-T) for IPsec,
        which means if any of your client machines are behind NAT, IPsec VPN
        will not work. This alone eliminates it as a possibility for most
        environments, since remote users will almost always need access from
        behind NAT. Many home networks use a NAT router of some sort, as do
        most hot spot locations, hotel networks, etc.</para>
      <note>
        <para>NAT-T is supported in m0n0wall version 1.3 beta.</para>
      </note>
      <para>One good use of the m0n0wall IPsec client VPN capabilities is to
        secure all traffic sent by hosts on a wireless network or other
        untrusted network. This will be described later in this
        chapter.</para>
      <para>FIXME - A second limitation is the lack of any really good, free
        IPsec VPN clients for Windows. Most of your remote users will likely
        be Windows laptop users, so this is another major hindrance.</para>
      <para>For most situations, PPTP is probably the best remote access VPN
        option in m0n0wall right now. See the PPTP chapter for more
        information.</para>
    </sect2>
    <sect2>
      <title>Tunnel Mode</title>
      <para>IPsec's Tunnel mode is supported on m0n0wall devices. This mode
        allows secured communication between entire subnets. When the packet
        leavs the subnet it will be encrypted, when it gets to the remote
        IPSec device the packets are decrypted and routed/ sent into the
        remote network.</para>
      <para>The IPsec Specification supports a 2nd mode of operation called
        Transport mode. Transport mode limits encrypted communication to the 2
        devices that are encrypting the information. If this was supported it
        would only allow secured communication to the m0n0wall device itself
        and not to its connected networks. Transport mode is not
        supported.</para>
    </sect2>
    <sect2>
      <title>Perfect Forward Secrecy</title>
      <para>This option increases security during authentication by assuring
        that new keys (which are generated on a regular basis to ensure
        security) are not based on previous keys. When activated, this means
        that if someone obtains or discovers 1 encryption key that they cannot
        use it to discover previous or future keys. This can be disabled to
        allow faster key negotiation.</para>
    </sect2>
    <sect2>
      <title>IPsec Software Clients</title>
      <para>Most operating systems include IPsec clients. Windows 2000 and
        above includes a free IPsec client but it is also difficult to
        configure. MacOSX 10.3 and later also includes a free IPsec client but
        the free configuration tool is for a special version of IPsec called
        L2TP/IPsec. Free configuration tools exist for both operating systems
        but commercial solutions, at least for Windows, are more evolved and
        easier to use than the built-in free version.</para>
      <note>
        <para>m0n0wall does not support L2TP so if your IPsec client software
          only supports L2TP it will not work with m0n0wall. However, for
          adventure seekers, there is a how to for using IPsec on a device and
          L2TP on an internal Windows 200x server to offset the encryption
          workload: <ulink url="http://koeppe-net.de/l2tp-howto.txt "

      <title>Dead Peer Detection</title>
      <para>Starting in firmware 1.3b11 it is possible to configure a Dead
        Peer Detection (DPD) interval in seconds with a default of seconds.
        This allows the m0n0wall device to detect if a tunnel is still being
        used. If the DPD interval has passed and the m0n0wall devices finds an
        IPsec tunnel is not exchanging phase 1 IKE messages (which should be

      <para>Without this option activated, an IPsec tunnel may be left open

        <para>Firmware 1.3b11 also includes a fix for m0n0wall preferring new
          SAs over old SAs by default (should solve problems with tunnels not
          working after an interruption or peer IP address change). In
          previous versions old SAs where preferred.</para>

      <title>Dynamic DNS Support</title>
      <para>Starting in firmware 1.3b6 it is possible to configure domain
        names to be IPsec connection endpoints. Although fixed IP addresses
        are recommended for building IPsec connections, using domain names
        allows IPsec usage with clients whose IP address may change frequently
        (a home Internet connection or a laptop user at a wireless hotspot for
        example.)</para>
      <para>The IPsec DNS Check Interval option is under the System &gt;
        Advanced menu. An interval time in seconds can be set here. If at
        least one IPsec tunnel has a host name (instead of an IP address) as
        the remote gateway, a DNS lookup is performed at the interval
        specified here, and if the IP address that the host name resolved to
        has changed, the IPsec tunnel is reconfigured. The default is 60
        seconds.</para>
      <para>The remote connection point must use a Dynamic DNS client software
        that registers any IP address changes with the domain server.</para>

    <sect2>
      <title>NAT Traversal</title>
      <para>Starting in firmware 1.3b2 it is possible to use NAT Traversal
        (NAT-T) with IPsec connections. This feature allows IPsec clients to
        be behind a NAT device (common in a home or office firewall). Using
        ESP packets to transmit encrypted data does not allow it to pass
        through a NAT transformation but encapsulating the encrypted data in
        UDP packets allows the data to pass through NAT
        transformations.</para>
      <para>Using NAT-T creates two types of traffic: IKE authentication
        (phase 1) on UDP 500 and encrypted data (phase 2) on UDP 4500. These
        two ports must be allowing data on the m0n0wall device and not be
        blocked by any intervening firewalls. This feature can be turned on or
        off for each IPsec connection.</para>
    </sect2>
    <sect2>
      <title>IPsec Traffic Filtering</title>
      <para>Starting in firmware 1.3b6 there is firewall support for
        decapsulated IPsec packets (new pseudo-interface "IPsec" in firewall
        rule editor); this is on by default, but the default configuration
        contains a "pass all" rule on the new IPsec pseudo- interface (and
        this is also added automatically for existing configurations), which
        can then be deleted to actually filter IPsec VPN traffic.</para>
      <para>To configure filtering on IPsec traffic, select the IPsec
        interface from the list of interfaces that packets must come in to
        match the selected rule.</para>
      <note>
        <para>These rules are applied to all IPsec connection traffic. The
          only way to apply rules to specific connections is to additionally
          use a source IP address or subnet that is used on a selected remote
          IPsec connection.</para>

        <para>Both locations must be using non-overlapping LAN IP

        <para>i.e. if both sites are using 192.168.1.0/24 on the LAN, no site
          to site VPN will work. This is not a limitation in m0n0wall, it's
          basic IP routing. When any host on either of your networks tries to
          communicate with 192.168.1.0/24, it will consider that host to be on
          its local LAN and the packets will never reach m0n0wall to be passed
          over the VPN connection. Similarly, if one site is using, for
          example, 192.168.0.0/16 and one using 192.168.1.0/24, these subnets
          are also overlapping and a site to site VPN will not work.</para>
        <para>Keep in mind the more networks you link together the more
          important this basic fact becomes. Do not use unnecessarily large
          subnet masks. If you setup your LAN as 10.0.0.0/8, but only have 100
          hosts on it, you're unnecessarily limiting your ability to add VPN

          will not be able to limit which hosts can be accessed by users
          across the VPN connection. If a worm would get into the network you
          are connected to via VPN, it could easily spread to your network. If

          could then infect your machines and continue to propagate over the

          option; this means your entire LAN will be accessible from the
          remote network. IMPORTANT: The other end of the tunnel has this same
          field, well it probably has 99% of these fields actually, make sure
          the other end is set exactly as you set this end. E.g. if you said

      <title>What if your m0n0wall is not the main Internet Firewall?</title>
      <para>FIXME - In some cases you have a firewall or router with layer 2
        routing (protocol ACLs) sitting in front of your m0n0wall. If this is
        the case you will need to port forward ESP or AH (depending on which
        one you chose) to the m0n0wall. (NOTE: if you are running NAT on that
        firewall AH will not be an option.)</para>
      <para>Starting in m0n0wall firmware 1.3 NAT-T traversal is supported.
        This allows all ESP packets to be encapsulated in UDP packets using
        port 4500. Allowing and redirecting UDP 500 traffic (used for IKE
        authentication in phase 1) and UDP 4500 (NAT-T encapsulated data
        packets in phase 2) allows the m0n0wall to be placed behind another

          </question>
          <answer>
            <para>Some users have an IP address that changes regularly, The
              changing IP address can be on either the m0n0wall device or the
              remote IPSec VPN client. For example a dialup account, DSL
              Internet modem or simply moving a laptop computer from one
              wireless hotspot to another all can cause IP addresses that
              change. While the changing IP address does not affect normal
              Internet usage, it will break IPSec tunnels that are configured
              to use a specific DNS name or IP address.</para>
            <para>A dynamic DNS name will allow you to keep the same name and
              can be used with m0n0wall. M0n0wall version 1.2 supports dynamic
              DNS for its own interface but does not support a domain name for

          <answer>
            <para>By default, fragmented packets are not allowed to be

              Advanced &gt; Miscellaneous menu by checking the "Allow
              fragmented IPsec packets" box. When activated, this will cause
              m0n0wall to allow fragmented IP packets that are encapsulated in
              IPsec ESP packets.</para>

          <answer>
            <para>By default, if several Security Associations (SAs) match,
              the newest one is preferred if it's at least 30 seconds old.
              This default can be changed in the System &gt; Advanced &gt;
              Miscellaneous menu by checking the "Prefer old IPsec SAs" When
              activated, this option always prefers old SAs over new

            <para>Can I route any traffic over my IPsec connection?</para>
          </question>
          <answer>
            <para>Part of the IPsec configuration identifies local and remote
              networks. IP addresses that are outside of those networks are
              not authorized to travel through an IPsec connection. This means
              that if you have additional routed networks connected to your
              LAN, they may not be able to travrse the IPsec connection
              because they do not originate from the LAN itself.</para>
            <para>If you have an additional network or subnet that you want to
              travel through IPsec you can make additional tunnels or
              optionally put a NAT device between the LAN network and the
              other subnets so that traffic from the additional network will
              appear to be coming from the authorized network.</para>

          <answer>
            <para>Not with IPsec. Broadcasts don't cross broadcast domains. In
              the case of a VPN link, each network is its own broadcast
              domain. Normally you don't want to connect broadcast domains
              because most networks have way more broadcast traffic than you
              want to push over a VPN connection. </para>

    <title>Quick Start for RSA Signature Authentication</title>
    <para>From Lynn Grant, <ulink
        url="http://m0n0.ch/wall/list/showmsg.php?id=353/09">as contributed to
        the mailing list</ulink>. </para>
    <para>You will need to generate a certificate and a private key for each
      router. You can do this with OpenSSL, and there are several tutorials on
      the web about how to do this. A quicker way is to use the XCA program,
      from Christian Hohnstaedt. It is available here
      (http://sourceforge.net/projects/xca) as a *nix tarbal or a Windows exe
      file, and is licensed under a BSD-like license. </para>
    <para>First you need to create a Certification Authority (CA) key to use
      in signing your certificates. Bring up XCA, and click on the "Private
      Keys" tab, then click the "New Key" button. Give the key a name like "My
      Company Certificate Authority". Keytype should be "RSA". The default
      keysize of 1024 is probably about right. </para>
    <para>Now click on the "Certificates" tab, and click the "New Certificate"
      button. On the "Create x509 Certificate" page, select "Create a self
      signed certificate with the serial 1". Click on the "Subject" tab. For
      "Internal name" and "Common name", use something like "My Company
      Certificate Authority". Fill in the other fields at the top of the page
      (Country code, State or Province -- spelled out, by the way -- Locality,
      Organisation, Organ. unit, E-mail address). Click on the "Extensions"
      tab. Set the type to "Certification Authority". Uner "Key Identifier",
      select "Subject Key Identifier". Click on the "Key Usage" tab and select
      "Certificate Sign". Click the "OK" button.</para>
    <para>Now that you have a certificate signing certificate, you can make
      certificates for all of your routers. </para>
    <para>In XCA, click on the "private keys" tab, then click the "New Key"
      button. Give the key a name that lets you remember which router it goes
      to. Keytype should be "RSA", and the default of 1024 bit keysize is
      probably about right. Click the "Create" button. Do this for each
      router. </para>
    <para>Click on the "Certificates" tab, then click the "New Certificate"
      button. On the "Source" page, select "Use this Certificate for signing",
      and select your CA certificate. (This value should be in the field by
      default.) On the "Subject" page, enter the information for your router.
      I use the router name as the Internal Name and Common Name. Click on the
      "Extensions" tab. Set the type to "End Entity" and under "Key
      Identifier", select "Subject Key Identifier".</para>
    <para>Now comes the most important part. In the "subject alternative name"
      field, put "IP:" followed by the IP address of the interface, for
      example "IP:10.0.0.1". This must match the IP address of the interface
      that the VPN goes over; if you have VPNs on the WAN interface, and VPNs
      to internal routers on the LAN interface, you will need two separate
      certificates. Click on "OK" to create your certificate. Repeat this for
      each router.</para>
    <para>Now select each router certificate under the "Certificates" tab and
      click on the "Export" button. Choose a file name. Select "PEM" for the
      export format and click "OK".</para>
    <para>Now click the "Private Keys" tab. Select the private key for each
      router, and click on the "Export" button. Choose a file name. Select
      "PEM" for the export format and click "OK". Keep in mind that the key
      files are the key to the router's identity, so be sure to delete them as
      soon as your are done setting up the routers. </para>
    <para>It is probably best to get your VPN tunnel working in Pre-Shared Key
      mode first, so you can get any kinks out of the other parameters, before
      you add the additional complexity of certificates. Bring up the
      VPN:IPSEC:Edit Tunnel page on your M0n0walls. If you already have the
      tunnel working in Pre-Shared Key mode, you can bring them up
      side-by-side in two browser windows, which will make things easier. Just
      be sure to move slowly and read all the directions before you do
      anything, so you don't lose contact with the remote M0n0wall before you
      get it set up. </para>
    <para>Lets say your two routers are RouterA and RouterB. On RouterA,
      change the "Authentication Method" to "RSA Signature". Bring up the
      RouterA certificate in your favorite text editor. It should look
      something like this: </para>

    <para>Click the "Save" button on each page.</para>
    <para>You will now have an "Apply Changes" button at the top of each page.
      Here is the critical part. As soon as you click either of the "Apply

      tunnel is re-established. So the proper order is: <orderedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>Click "Apply Changes" on the remote router's page.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>Click "Apply Changes" on the local router's page. </para>
        </listitem>
      </orderedlist></para>
    <para>The local router's page should refresh almost immediately. The
      remote router will take a little longer, since the tunnel has to be
      re-established, but if you did everything right, it should come up
      shortly. If the tunnel is slow coming up, you may have to refresh the
      page if it times out. If something got messed up, like you pasted the
      wrong certificate in the wrong box, or you got the IP address wrong in
      the subject alternative key, you will have to change both M0n0wall's
      back to Pre-Shared Key authentication (which will involve physically
      going to where the remote router is, since you can't talk to it any
      more) and start over. </para>
    <para>Don't forget to delete the files you exported the private keys to
      when you are done setting up! </para>
