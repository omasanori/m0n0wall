  <title>Wireless</title>

  <para>Wireless functionality is available for selected wireless cards. The
  1.2.x version of m0n0wall allows some 802.11b wireless adapters/chipsets
  (most notably Lucent Hermes and Intersil Prism II/2.5 to join a wireless
  network with WEP encryption. The upcoming 1.3.x version which is based on
  FreeBSD 6, supports (almost) all Atheros-based 802.11a/b/g cards as well
  (and some Ralink cards too) and offers more capabilities. Version 1.3.x
  allows the use of enhanced encryption, using the m0n0wall as an access
  point, and the capability to use a Radius server for authentication.</para>

  <note>
    <para>Version 1.3.x m0n0wall is still in beta testing and features can
    change before it is released as a stable version.</para>

    <title>Adding A Wireless Interface</title>

    <para>The default m0n0wall configuration includes a LAN and WAN interface.
    If you have an installed wireless card you will have to add the interface
    manually. Below are the steps needed to install this interface using the
    web interface of your m0n0wall device.</para>
